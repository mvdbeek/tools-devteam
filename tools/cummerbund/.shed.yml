description: CummeRbund is an R package that is designed to aid and simplify the task of analyzing Cufflinks RNA-Seq output.
long_description: |
  CummeRbund takes the various output files from a cuffdiff run and creates a SQLite database of the
  results describing appropriate relationships betweeen genes, transcripts, transcription start sites,
  and CDS regions. Once stored and indexed, data for these features, even across multiple samples or conditions,
  can be retrieved very efficiently and allows the user to explore subfeatures of individual genes, or genesets as the analysis requires.
